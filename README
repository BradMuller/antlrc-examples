Providing a build system for examples using ANTLR, libantlr3c and
the Haskell antlrc runtime binding is difficult due to the following
issues:

(1) There is no ANTLR 3.2 or 3.3 ebuild for Gentoo Linux, and hence no
standard location for the ANTLR jar files.

(2) There is no standard antlr command to run the ANTLR parser generator tool
provided by ANTLR:

http://www.antlr.org/jira/browse/ANTLR-369

There is currently no build system.  I may try to create one using
autotools, and assuming that the user has created an antlr script
file in the users path to run the antlr parser generator.
